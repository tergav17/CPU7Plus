# CPU7Plus
A GUI-based emulator for the Centurion-series minicomputer

Right now this is more or less functional. The basic CPU emulation passed the DIAG test, and has been made to be compatible with the instruction descriptions found in the EE200 reference manual. There is still much work to be done, but it works well enough to use.

There are additional tools like the memory loader, memory viewer, and diagnostic panel which also work.
